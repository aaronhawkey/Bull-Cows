# Bull-Cows
A simple C++ console game.

This is a game I made in my class. I am working on optimizing and randomizing the isograms
that are generated. There are functions that exists but are not being used for this. I will be updating
it later. Let me know if there are any errors or optimizations that can be made. I am open to suggestions.
